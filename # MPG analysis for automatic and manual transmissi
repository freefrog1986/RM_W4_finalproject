# MPG analysis for automatic and manual transmissions

### Summary
( Did the report include an executive summary )
exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

### Exploratory Data Analyses
( do some exploratory data analyses ) 
First, let's do some exploratory data analyses.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
setwd('/Users/freefrog/Studing/DataScience/gitrepo/EDA_W4_finalproject')
rm(list = ls())
```{}

```{r}
data('mtcars')
head(mtcars)
```
There are 11 variables. We care about mpg and am, which stand for Miles/(US) gallon and Transmission (0=automatic, 1=manual)
```{r}

```


### Model Selection
Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection
(interpret the coefficients correctly)

### Residual and Diagnostics
Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics

### Answer the Questions
Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable

#### Question1
“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?”

#### Question2
"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

### Conclusions
Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly?
