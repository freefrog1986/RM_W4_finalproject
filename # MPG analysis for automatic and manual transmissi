# MPG analysis for automatic and manual transmissions

### Summary
( Did the report include an executive summary )
exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

### Exploratory Data Analyses
( do some exploratory data analyses ) 
First, let's do some exploratory data analyses.
Load ggplot2, set working directory.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
setwd('/Users/freefrog/Studing/DataScience/gitrepo/RM_W4_finalproject')
rm(list = ls())
```
Have a glance of the data.
```{r}
data('mtcars')
head(mtcars)
```
There are 11 variables. We only care about mpg and am, which stand for Miles/(US) gallon and Transmission (0=automatic, 1=manual), we can make a boxplot which can be found in Apendix Figure-1.
```{r}
df<-mtcars
png(filename = "plot1.png", width = 560, height = 480)
g<-ggplot(df,aes(am,mpg))
g+geom_boxplot(aes(group=am),colour = "#3366FF")+xlab("Transmission") +ylab("Miles/(US) gallon") +ggtitle("Figure-1: Relationship between MPG and Transmission")
dev.off()
```
### Model Selection
####Model 1: liner regression
This figure can be find in Apendix Figure-2
```{r}
png(filename = "plot2.png", width = 560, height = 480)
with(df, plot(df$mpg,df$am, xlab = "Miles/(US) gallon", ylab = "Transmission", main = 'Figure-2 liner regression'))
model<-lm(am~mpg,data=df)
abline(model, lwd = 1, col = "skyblue2")
dev.off()

```
####Model 1: logistic regression



Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection
(interpret the coefficients correctly)

### Residual and Diagnostics
Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics

### Answer the Questions
Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable

#### Question1
“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?”

#### Question2
"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

### Conclusions
Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly?
